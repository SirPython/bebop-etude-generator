# -so middle c is 0
# -define a range. for example, for saxophone, it'd be -2 to 30
# -randomly displace the first chord tone
# -look at the next chord tone
# -what is the smallest interval between these two chord tones? (consider both
# in the range 0 to 11)
# -determine based on the smaller interval if the second chord tone should be
# placed above or below the current chord tone
# -if it goes out of range, displace by an octave
# -generate the approach notes
# -if any of the approaches go out of range, displace by an octave
